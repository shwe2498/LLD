Builder Design Pattern

The Builder Design Pattern  allows us to build complex objects by separating the construction of the objects from its representation.
-- Separates construction of complex objects 
Unlike the Factory and Abstract Factory which build objects in one shot. Builder allows us to build complex objects one step at a time.
-- Same construction process for different representations
It allows us to use the same step or process to create different representation of the complex object.
